        </h4>
          Programming isn't all about cool glasses, San Francisco startups, job security or money.
          (We do this because we love it, we code 40 hours a week, and then we go home and read more stuff!)
          (Programming is challenging, hard work. You're going to fail... alot! Passion is what garuntees you don't quit, ship crappy code, or burnout.)
          (BTW if you disagree with what I just said, find a new job... you're not pushing yourself hard enough!)
        </h4>
        <p>
          “Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.” Linus Torvalds
